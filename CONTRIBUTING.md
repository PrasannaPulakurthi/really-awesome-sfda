Thanks for helping improve Awesome SFDA!

## Entry rules
- Use: `- [Title (Venue/Year)](paper) â€” one sentence. [code](repo)`
- Keep one concise sentence; avoid marketing language.
- Prefer official code; otherwise note "reproduction".
- Place entries under the most specific section; avoid duplicates.
- Sort alphabetically by title within sections.
- Check links (no 404s), use HTTPS when available.

## PR checklist
- Section chosen correctly and sorted.
- Paper and code links verified.
- `npx awesome-lint` passes locally (or see CI results).

## Sorting specifics
- Within each section: alphabetical by title.
- For 2024+ items: add to the appropriate section and also mirror into the top "Recent (2024+)" block (sorted newest-first).

## Ground rules
- Be respectful (see Code of Conduct).
- Significant reorganizations should open an issue first.
